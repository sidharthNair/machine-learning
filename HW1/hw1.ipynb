    "**Million Dollar Question**\n",

    "For this problem, you will work on the Netflix dataset, where one needs to predict missing (movie, user) ratings. The problem of predicting missing values for a recommender system is formally known as Collaborative Filtering. Read more about the Netflix challenge and the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data).\n",
    "\n",
    "The complete Netflix dataset has 480,189 users, 17,770 movies, and 100,480,507 ratings. So, the scale of the problem is huge. For this assignment we will work on a much smaller subset of 2000 users, 1821 movies and 220,845 ratings. You can download this subset dataset from Canvas > Files > HW1 > dataset.zip\n",
    "\n",
    "We will take an approach based on Matrix Factorization which was also used by a leading team for Netflix challenge. Let us first introduce some notation. Let there be $u$ users and $m$ movies and let $R\\in \\mathbb{R}^{u\\times m}$ be the ratings matrix where element $R_{ij}$ is the rating given by user $i$ for movie $j$. Note that the matrix $R$ has many missing values - in the entire Netflix dataset, $\\sim 94\\%$ of the entries are missing. Think of factoring the matrix $R\\approx U^T M$, where $U\\in \\mathbb{R}^{k\\times u}$ and $M \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k\\times m}$ and $k\\ll \\min(u, m)$. Intuitively, you can think of column $\\bm{u}_i$ of $U$ as a low-dimensional feature vector for the $i$-th user, and the column $\\bm{m}_j$ of $M$ as a low-dimensional feature vector for the $j$-th movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the above notation,  the rating $R_{ij}$ for a movie $j$ by user $i$ is approximated as $R_{ij}\\approx \\bm{u}_i^T\\bm{m}_j$. Thus, the Matrix Factorization approach involves finding $U$ and $M$ such that $U^TM$ is as close to $R$ as possible. Formally the problem can be stated as:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "  %\\label{eq:prob1}\n",
    "  \\min_{U, M}\\ \\|R-U^TM\\|_F^2+\\lambda(\\|U\\|_F^2+\\|M\\|_F^2),\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $\\|\\cdot\\|_F$ denotes the Frobenius norm, and where we have added regularization terms (as in ridge regression) and the regularization parameter $\\lambda\\in [0, 1]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is in general hard to solve as both $U$ and $M$ need to be inferred and no known method guarantees the optimal solution. Instead, we use  a heuristic which works well in practice. We use the method of Alternating Minimization, where in each iteration we fix $U$ to compute $M$, and  subsequently fix $M$ to compute $U$, and so on. Now we describe the method to compute $M$ assuming $U$ to be fixed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $U$  be fixed, then equation 1 reduces to:\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "  %\\label{eq:prob2}\n",
    "  \\min_{M}\\ \\|R-U^TM\\|_F^2+\\lambda\\|M\\|_F^2,\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "This problem can be decoupled in terms of columns of $M$, $\\bm{m}_j$, i.e., \n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "  %\\label{eq:prob2}\n",
    "  \\min_{\\{\\bm{m}_1, \\bm{m}_2, \\dots, \\bm{m}_m\\}}\\ \\sum_j\\|\\bm{r}_j-U^T\\bm{m}_j\\|_2^2+\\lambda\\sum_j\\|\\bm{m}_j\\|_2^2,\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "where $\\bm{r}_j$ denote the $j$-th column of $R$. Thus, we can solve a separate ridge regression problem for each $j$, i.e.,\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "  %\\label{eq:prob2}\n",
    "  \\min_{\\bm{m}_j}\\ \\|\\bm{r}_j-U^T\\bm{m}_j\\|_2^2+\\lambda\\|\\bm{m}_j\\|_2^2,\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "However, the vector $\\bm{r}_j$, which represents ratings for  movie $j$, may have many missing values. Let there be $n_j$ known ratings for the movie $j$. Then,the ridge regression should be solved using only $n_j$ ratings, i.e. let $\\bm{r}_j^{({\\cal K_j})}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_j}$ denote the known ratings for movie $j$, and $U^{({\\cal K}_j)}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{k\\times n_j}$ denote the submatrix of $U$ for the corresponding users who rated movie $j$. Thus the problem can be written as:\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "  %\\label{eq:prob2}\n",
    "  \\min_{\\bm{m}_j}\\ \\|\\bm{r}_j^{({\\cal K_j})}-\\left(U^{({\\cal K}_j)}\\right)^T\\bm{m}_j\\|_2^2+\\lambda\\|\\bm{m}_j\\|_2^2,\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "An analogous procedure can be used for computing $U$. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, for each iteration compute $U$ and $M$ using the procedure given above. Repeat this procedure for a fixed number of iterations. Initialize $U$ and $M$ randomly, fix the number of iterations $\\tau$ as $30$ and fix $k=10$. "
